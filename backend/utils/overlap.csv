increase is required to defray necessary operating costs or avoid jeopardizing the fiscal integrity of the housing project.

(B) If funds granted or loaned pursuant to this section constitute less than 25 percent of the total development cost or value, whichever is applicable, of a project assisted under this section, the department may adopt, by regulation, criteria for determining the number of units in a project to which the restrictions on occupancy contained in the agreement apply. In no event may these regulations provide for the application of the agreement to a percentage of units in a project that is less than the percentage of total development costs that funds granted or loaned pursuant to this section represent.

The department shall adopt by regulation criteria for the determination of the lien period. This regulation shall take into account whether the property is held by multifamily rental, single-family ownership, or cooperative ownership and whether it is new construction or rehabilitative construction. The lien period for manufactured housing liens for manufactured homes shall not exceed 10 years.

(5) Regulate the terms of occupancy agreements or resale controls, to be used in housing assisted pursuant to this section. 

(6) Provide linguistically appropriate services and publications, or require grantees to do so, as necessary to implement the purposes of this section.
