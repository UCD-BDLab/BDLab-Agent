    "### 1 - What `ask_phi3_chat(...)` actually sends\n",
    "\n",
    "* You pass a `messages` list with roles `system`, `user`, and later `assistant`.\n",
    "* The tokenizer’s `chat_template` wraps each message like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `<|system|>\\n...<|end|>\\n`\n",
    "  * `<|user|>\\n...<|end|>\\n`\n",
    "  * `<|assistant|>\\n...<|end|>\\n`\n",
    "* Because you call `apply_chat_template(..., add_generation_prompt=True)`, the template **adds one more** `<|assistant|>\\n` at the end. That tag says: “Now it’s the assistant’s turn—generate the next reply.”\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<|system|> ... <|end|>\n",
    "<|user|>   ... <|end|>\n",

    "<|assistant|>                # <-- model starts generating here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2 - How your debate loop uses the roles\n",
    "\n",
    "* `alice_msgs = [{\"role\":\"system\", ...}]`: sets global rules for Alice.\n",
    "  This is where you impose “3–5 sentences, rebuttal, end with a question.”\n",
    "* You append a **user** message: “Start with your stance…”\n",
    "  → Alice’s model sees `<|system|>...<|end|>\\n<|user|>Start...<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>` and produces Alice’s **first** assistant reply.\n",
    "* You then append that reply to history as `{\"role\":\"assistant\", \"content\": alice_text}`.\n",
    "  This is crucial: it lets Alice “remember” what she just said on later turns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vicente is identical but with his own `system` message. For Vicente’s first **user** message you include Alice’s last text (“Alice said: ... Your rebuttal:”). That turns Alice’s text into *Vicente’s input* (a `user` turn from Vicente’s perspective), so Vicente replies appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3 - Why two separate histories?\n",
    "\n",
    "* You keep `alice_msgs` and `vicente_msgs` separate because each model plays a different persona.\n",
    "* Each history contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * its **own** `system` rules (persona + debate constraints), and\n",
    "  * alternating turns where we (the orchestrating script) feed in the opponent’s last message as a **user** message.\n",
    "* After each generation, you append the model’s output to its own history as an **assistant** message so it has memory of its prior stance, tone, and claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "(You *could* run a single shared history, but with two distinct models/voices it’s simpler and cleaner—no risk of the model responding as the wrong speaker.)\n",

    "\n",

    "* Now, each side “sees” what it said (assistant history) and what the other side just said (new user turn), so it naturally moves forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6 - Small tips (still using your function)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keep `max_new_tokens` tight (your 140 is fine) to enforce brief turns.\n",
    "* If you ever see the model adding speaker labels, you can ask it not to in the `system` rules (“Do not write speaker labels.”).\n",
    "* If turns get long, you can trim what you quote from the opponent in the **user** message (e.g., only last \\~800–1000 chars) to keep prompts lean.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s the whole mapping: **system** = global rules/persona, **user** = the opponent’s latest message (what this speaker should respond to), **assistant** = the speaker’s previous replies so they have memory. The final `<|assistant|>` tag (added by `add_generation_prompt=True`) is the cue for the next answer.\n"

How can we justify the immense risks and costs associated with Europa when Mars presents a more attainable goal for humanity\n",
      "Alice:    Vicente, while the risks and costs associated with Europa are indeed significant, they should not deter us from exploring all potential options for human colonization. The challenges of Europa's radiation and technological demands are not insurmountable but rather catalysts for innovation and progress. The presence of a subsurface ocean and the possibility of extraterrestrial life make Europa a unique and valuable target for exploration. By investing in the technologies needed to overcome these challenges, we can not only expand our understanding of the universe but also develop new solutions that could benefit life on Earth. How do you propose we balance the risks and rewards of\n",
      "Vicente:  Alice, I understand your enthusiasm for the potential of Europa and the allure of extraterrestrial life. However, we must prioritize the safety and well-being of our astronauts. The radiation levels on Europa are far beyond what we can currently protect against, and the technological hurdles are immense. Mars, with its more manageable radiation environment and the presence of water ice, offers a safer and more practical starting point for human colonization. By focusing our efforts on Mars, we can build a foundation for future missions to more challenging environments like Europa. How do you envision the technological advancements required for Europa exploration\n",
      "Alice:    Vicente, the safety and well-being of astronauts are indeed paramount, and Mars does offer a more immediate and practical starting point for human colonization. However, the pursuit of knowledge and the expansion of human presence in the solar system should not be limited by current technological constraints. The challenges of Europa's radiation and technological demands are significant, but they also present an opportunity for groundbreaking advancements in space exploration technology. By investing in research and development to overcome these challenges, we can not only make Europa a viable option for human colonization but also develop new technologies that could benefit life on Earth.
